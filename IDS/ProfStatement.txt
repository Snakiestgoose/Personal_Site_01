I first became interested in programming and digital media my freshman year of college. The first computer science class I took was the spring of that year at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. I also took a computer animation class that semester. The high school I went to did not offer any classes in computer science or any kind of arts, only a CAD program of which I was in. I really enjoyed the classes and transferred to UCF to try out their animation program as it is well revered.

A big different in UCF’s animation program over SIUC’s program was the emphasis on art. I prefer the technical side of animation and was not enjoying the extensive foundation art classes and thus decided to find a program more suited to my interests. This is how I eventually came to build my degree around digital media and computer science. Through these programs I have developed my interests to game and web design and development. I have participated in game jams and educational projects that has allowed me to explore what real world experience would be like in these fields and I hope to continue that development beyond academia.
